In this project, we will analyze past sales data from Corporation Favorita. Also, we will analyze other occurrences that may have impact on the sales performance of the retail store chains.

Also, we will build different machine learning models, evaluate the models, test the models, compare performances of the models and select the model that best predicts future grocery sales.
