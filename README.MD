Welcome to the Regression ProjectHow can you put data to work for you? Specifically, how can numbers in a spreadsheet tell us about present and past business activities, and how can we use them to forecast the future? The answer is in building quantitative models, and this project is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of this critical, foundational, business skill. 

“Regression” is a generic term for statistical methods that attempt to fit a model to data, in order to quantify the relationship between the dependent (outcome) variable and the predictor (independent) variable(s)

This module explores regression models, which allow you to start with data and discover an underlying process. Regression models are the key tools in predictive analytics, and are also used when you have to incorporate uncertainty explicitly in the underlying data. 

In this Project, you will: 

learn more about regression models, what they can and cannot do, and the questions regression models can answer. 
examine correlation and linear association and methodology to fit the best line to the data.
interpret regression coefficients, multiple regression, and logistic regression. 
see how logistic regression will allow you to estimate probabilities of success. 

By the time you are done with this project, you’ll be able to identify regression models and their key components, understand when they are used, and be able to interpret them so that you can discuss your model and convince others that your model makes sense, with the ultimate goal of implementation.
Skill sets you will build:Data exploration
Missing value computations
Feature engineering
Model Development using Machine Learning Algorithms like Linear Regression, XGBoost, ARIMA, SARIMA etc.
Model Evaluation and Interpretation using RMSLE, RME, MSE, and other techniques
Model Optimization and hyper parameter tuning
